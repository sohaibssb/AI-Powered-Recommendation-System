# AI-Powered Recommendation System
Programmed by Sohaibssb as part of Artificial intelligence systems Course at Bauman University.

## **Branches**

- **main**: Contains the original codebase.  
- **Develop**: Includes the updated, modularized code with the new structure for better maintainability.

Description:
This project implements a recommendation system using various machine learning (ML) and natural language processing techniques, such as clustering, similarity scoring, and vectorization. Developed with Python, it uses data manipulation and analysis libraries to provide robust recommendations based on user preferences.

Features:
1- Clustering & Feature Extraction:
Uses the k-means and DBSCAN methods for clustering data.
Reduces feature dimensionality using PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and more.
2- Similarity Calculations:
Implements Jaccard, Euclidean, and Cosine similarity algorithms to assess similarity scores between items.
Supports feature vector comparisons and numerical similarity.
3- Natural Language Processing:
Tokenizes and preprocesses text data for similarity analysis.
Implements frequency-based (tf*idf) and vector models for feature extraction.
4- Dense Neural Networks:
Leverages neural networks to classify and cluster data, improving recommendation accuracy.
